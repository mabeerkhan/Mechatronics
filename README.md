## Mechatronics Final Project
#### SURVEILLANCE CAR USING ESP-32 CAM MODULE

The project aims to create a surveillance car that can operate in various environments, providing real-time monitoring, threat detection, and situational awareness. This involves developing algorithms and implementing software that can analyze sensor data, perform object recognition, track movements, and identify potential security breaches.

The ESP32 surveillance car project aims to design and develop a versatile and efficient vehicle equipped with the ESP32 microcontroller for surveillance tasks. The ESP32 microcontroller offers powerful capabilities, including Wi-Fi connectivity, dual-core processing, and adequate GPIO pins, making it an ideal choice for integrating advanced surveillance technology.
